Mervin,
Section 3 discusses the Eureka Server. Since the Eureka server is the application that holds all the route information
it does not need to be a client as well. Each service that connects to the Eureka service needs to be configured
 as a Eureka client. This is accomplished by adding the spring-cloud-starter-eureka dependency.

 Adding the @EnableEurekaClient annotation is optional in a boot application as adding the dependency is enough
 to trigger client construction on start up.
